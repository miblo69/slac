# slac
Simple Log Analysis Center

This project intends to analyze web server log files and present some intelligent clues to which security exposure your site has. 

SLAC was started in the year 2000, and has seen little development since then. It was used by a few of my clients at the time, and remained forgotten. Now it has been superceeded by a numerous amount of online analytics services, SIEM and whatnot, so instead of scrapping the whole thing I thought I'd place a backup copy on GitHub. ;)

That said, I heard in 2017 that one of my old clients still uses it for assessing the security on their online gambling websites.

Uses Perl and a bunch of modules to work.
