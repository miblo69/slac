This is a perl project I started back in 2001, to analyze various types of logs for security issues. Analysis started with Web Logs, and has expanded into firewall logs etc

Now I want to get this started again, plus I need a repository for my code...

Anyone is welcome to use it, but there are no guarantees whatsoever of functionality. It is provided 'as-is'.

Back in the day. this was an 'e-mail in, Report out' service. I.e. e-mail your logs to the system, they would be analyzed, and a report sent back to the Sender. 

I even added automated PGP encryption/decryption for protecting the logfiles in transit...

But today, all is web based. The logic for the analysis should remane the same, but the frontend needs some work. As well as integration. And analysis. And..... a whole bunch of other stuff.
